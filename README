libbl3mod

C library for Borderlands 3 hotfix mods
By HackerSmacker, licensed under the terms of the GPLv3 license

Installation on UNIX/Linux/WSL/Cygwin/MacOS/BSD:
After downloading the source, simply run make and make install to
install libbl3mod. The headers will be copied to /usr/local/include/libbl3mod
so you will have to put #include <libbl3mod/bl3mod.h> in your source. The
library will be at /usr/local/lib/libbl3mod.a, so passing -lbl3mod to the
linker or C compiler will link the executable.

Installation on Windows (Visual Studio):
First, run a command shell that has cl, nmake, link, and lib in your path.
This can be done easily by running the "developer command prompt" for your
version. There is an nmake-compatible Makefile, so running nmake will compile
everything. Then, set INCLUDE and LIB to point to the directories where you
copied the headers and libbl3mod.lib. You need to invoke nmake like this:
nmake -f Makefile.vsc

And now, for the systems nobody in the world is gonna use:

Installation on DOS, OS/2, and Windows (Watcom C/C++):
After putting wmake, wcc386, wlink, and wlib into your shell path and setting
INCLUDE and WATCOM, go ahead and run wmake -f Makefile.watcom to compile
everything. Installation follows the same procedure as Visual Studio - simply
copy the libraries and headers to somewhere and append them to your include
and library paths. 

Installation on VMS:
The package comes with a MAKE_VMS.COM script, simply run it like so: 
@MAKE_VMS and it will compile. From there, you can use LINK and link your
program against the OLB.

Installation on VM/CMS:
TODO: write instructions for VM/370 compile

Installation on RSX-11:
Like the VMS version, there's a MAKE_RSX.COM to do the dirty work for you. 
Simply follow the same procedure to compile it as you would on VMS, and be
sure to link it against the same OLB library. Using the Task Builder works 
as well, but really the LINK command is way better.
